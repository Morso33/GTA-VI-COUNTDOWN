# GTA 6 Countdown Wallpaper

A simple Python script that displays the number of days left until the release of **GTA 6** directly on your desktop wallpaper.  
The countdown is dynamically updated on startup, overlaying the number of days on a **random screenshot** from the Rockstar Games website. Images can be added / modified manually, without touching any code.
